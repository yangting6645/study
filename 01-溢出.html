        Three years ago, I accidentally realized that my handwriting looks 
        sort of ugly; however, my best friend’s handwriting is real nice as 
        an art. Then I have a passion for the beauty of handwriting, so I 
        decided to practice calligraphy. But the result of half-year practice
        was unsatisfied than expected. I was very frustrated and want to give
        up. My friend found my sadness about that, she encouraged me and gave
        some advice like there was something wrong with my way to hold the
         pen. She corrected the holding position and encouraged me that I 
        could do better while kept practicing. With her enthusiastic help, 
        I stick at doing the calligraphy exercise and I have better 
        handwriting than before. Actually, I find joy in it and the 
        exercises become one of my habits and hobbies. Therefore the key
        to success consists in your persistence of the intention.
